    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Glaze</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ounce semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 11 donut cups with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat in 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and vanilla extract using an electric mixer. Beat until well blended.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into a zip-top bag and cut off 1 corner. Fill each donut cup about 3/4 full using the zip-top bag.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While donuts cool, combine 1/4 cup butter, cream, milk, corn syrup, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in bittersweet and semisweet chocolate until melted, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and whisk in powdered sugar to combine. Dip each cooled donut into the glaze and let cool and set, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
